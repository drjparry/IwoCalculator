## Notes on test

surge site: https://embarrassed-corn.surge.sh/

I completed this in two 2hr sessions. I managed to finish the basic functionality. Unfortunately I didn't have time to style it properly. I mostly TDD'ed as you can see in the commits but as I ran out of time I focused on finishing the basic funtionality as under 'Evaluation' you stated 'testing knowledge' which I had already shown but the top requirement was to focus on the maximum number of functionalities.

I believe I've shown a nice separation of concerns, however, there is plently I would improve given more time.

- The calculator misses a test for 'upfront fees'
- the component LoanCalculation is missing a testing file
- all tests could be more robust
- styling of the app
- some names could be better
- many functions could be smaller and further broken up
- number rounding and edge cases for the calculator
